# enesdir's dotfiles

![enesdir's dotfiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enesdir/dotfiles/master/media/iterm.png)

## Summary

What's in there?

- all my `brew` dependencies including: applications, fonts, etc. See [`Brewfile`](https://github.com/enesdir/dotfiles/blob/main/brew/Brewfile)
- all my `macOS` configuration. See [`macos`](https://github.com/enesdir/dotfiles/tree/main/macos/)
- all my `vscode` configuration. See `vscode/`

## Installation

These dotfiles use [`dotbot`](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot/) for installation.

### Dependencies

- git

### Ready for setup

to set things up. Steps:

1. Clone this repo

  ```bash
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/enesdir/dotfiles .dotfiles
  ```

2. `cd` into `dotfiles/` folder

  ```bash
  cd .dotfiles
  ```

### Option 1 - For installing a predefined profile

```bash
bash ./install-profile <profile> [<configs...>]
# See meta/profiles/ for available profiles
```

### Option 2 - For installing single configurations

```bash
bash ./install-standalone <configs...>
# See meta/configs/ for available configurations
```

3. Manual - Copy your private ssh key into the .ssh folder

4. Secure your ssh folder

```bash
bash -l './scripts/configure-ssh.sh'
```

5. oh-my-fish installation

```bash
bash -l './scripts/install-omf.sh'
```

The installation scripts are idempotent and can therefore be executed safely multiple times.

## Contents

I am using default `iTerm` as terminal emulators.
I am using `fish` with [`oh-my-fish`](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)
as a main shell.
I also have a lot of tools to make my working experience better.

I mainly work with two stacks:

- `node` + `yarn` + `react` + `typescript`
- `python`

So, they are configured nice and smoothly.
You will have configured version managers, best practices, and useful tools.
And some productivity hacks!

### Apps(brew/)

I am using `brew` to install all free apps for my mac.
I also sync apps from AppStore with `brew`,
so the resulting [`Brewfile`](https://github.com/enesdir/dotfiles/blob/master/brew/Brewfile) contains everything.

### VS Code(vscode/)

I loved my `Visual Studio Code`. It is fast and beautiful.

Here's how my new `vscode` setup looks like:

Here's [a list of packages](https://github.com/enesdir/dotfiles/blob/main/packages/vscode-extensions.sh)

### Local configuration(dotfiles/)

Some of the used tools requires local configuration.

### Set your enviroment

- Before beginning, please make sure you have the following enviroment variable set.
  We are provided example enviroment variables in root directory
